## Code Style

This project uses **Oxlint** for linting with strict rules enabled.

### Key Rules

- Use `const` and `let`, never `var`
- Always use strict equality (`===`, `!==`)
- Always use curly braces for control structures
- No unused variables
- No debugger statements in production code

### Running Linter

```bash
# Check all files
bunx oxlint@latest --config .github/oxlintrc.json

# Check specific file
bunx oxlint@latest src/utils.ts

# Auto-fix issues (if available)
bunx oxlint@latest --config .github/oxlintrc.json --fix
```

## Testing

All new functionality should include tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run with coverage
bun test --coverage

# Run specific test file
bun test src/upload.test.ts

# Run in watch mode during development
bun test --watch
```

### Test Structure

Tests are located alongside source files or in `index.test.ts` for CLI tests.

Example test:

```typescript
import { expect, describe, it } from 'bun:test';
import { parseArgs } from 'node:util';

describe('CLI', () => {
  describe('parseArgs', () => {
    it('should parse all CLI options correctly', () => {
      // Your test here
    });
  });
});
```
